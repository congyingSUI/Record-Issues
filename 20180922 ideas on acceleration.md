Ready to optimize

1. image acquisition -> obtain byte image
2. copy the image to gpu image
3. precess the gpu images from l&r simultaneously using multithreading or others
4. give back gpu images,
5. transfer gpu images to bype images
6. phase wrapping, matching with cuda
7. compute 3D data with cudaPCL
